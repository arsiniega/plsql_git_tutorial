# PL/SQL GIT tutorial (Commit Push Branch Merge)
PDF designed to help using the GIT Extenstion plug-in tool

Required:

PL/SQL Developer 14.0.0.1961 

Git Extensions 3.3.1.7897 

Windows 10 64-bit.

I wanted to create a guide that explains how git extensions can be used instead of the standard BASH GIT text commands in a very descriptive and hopefully efficient way. 

Feel free to comment and or use the document as a reference for your own places of work.
